# Goals and Important Points
- Develop a lightweight database management system named BlazeDB.
1. Translate SQL queries to relational algebra query plans.  
2. Familiarize you with the iterator model for relational operator evaluation.  
3. Implement common operators (e.g., selection, projection, join, sort, aggregation).  

## Tasks:
Task 1 : Implementation of the iterator model and common operators.  
Task 2 : Optimisation of constructed query plans.
