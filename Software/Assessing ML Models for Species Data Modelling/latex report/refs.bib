   abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without being explicitly programmed. Learning algorithms in many applications that's we make use of daily. Every time a web search engine like Google is used to search the internet, one of the reasons that work so well is because a learning algorithm that has learned how to rank web pages. These algorithms are used for various purposes like data mining, image processing, predictive analytics, etc. to name a few. The main advantage of using machine learning is that, once an algorithm learns what to do with data, it can do its work automatically. In this paper, a brief review and future prospect of the vast applications of machine learning algorithms has been made.},
