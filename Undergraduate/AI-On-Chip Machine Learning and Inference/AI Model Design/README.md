# Requirments
Need to design 2 CNN models for 2 different datasets listed below  
Each models achieve the specified accuracy respectively  
The fewer parameter and MACs are the better  

## Dataset
1. [Fashion MNIST dataset, an alternative to MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/fashion_mnist/load_data)  (classification, Accuracy > 70%)​   
2. [CIFAR10 small images classification dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/cifar10/load_data) (classification, Accuracy > 70%​)
