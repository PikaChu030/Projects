# Projects
This project is to design Pipeline CPU and apply to some applications.  
Use tools to verify and check the wave of CPU behavior  

## ISA
R, I, S, U, SB, UJ-Type Instruction Sets Implementation  

## Architecture
SRAM, Decoder, Imm_ext, Reg_file, ALU, JB_unit, LD_Filter  

## Verification and Tools
nWave/ModelSim: Check the simulation wave  
Superlint/ICC: block coverage, expression coverage, toggle coverage, overall coverage  
Synopsys: Speed, Setup time, Hold time, Area, Power  
Layout/Synthesize: EDA Tools, Cadence, DRC, LVS(under SDC, IO constraints)  

## Applications
Merge Sort, Fibonacci
